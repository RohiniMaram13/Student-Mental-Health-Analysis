# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis
In this R project we  work  with two  datasets â€œStudents Mental Health Assessments" and "StressLevelDataset". This is a course project of Data Science Concepts and Principles covers the most of the concepts of Data Science .
Steps to run the code
1)Need to have R software downloaded and can open the code in R studios( this is my preference)
2)Dataset files: StressLevelDataset.csv and students_mental_health_survey.csv 
3)DataScience.Rmd is the file that has r code

Note: Make sure all the files are in the same folder
The DataScience.html file  helps you to have a complete view of the project
